Pencil stencils, by Alexandre Bourget
-------------------------------------

This package keeps track of my stencils, used in my Mock-ups, using the Pencil application.

You can find more about the Pencil app here:

To install this package, make a .zip file out of it, and import it as a new Stencil.

For now, it provides only the "Google Nav" plugin.  I hope I add more of those in the future.
